V 1.0 of the windows wallet

Note: After install change you config file by searching in file explorer for %appdata%, and go into the gremcoin folder. Open the gremcoin.conf in note pad and remove the current node and replace it with roller.gremcoin.vip
Make sure to do save as, then change the file type in the drop down box to "all files" and click on the gremcoin.conf in the file browser to save it correctly. Then restart gremcoin-qt to have the new node attached and wait for the network to sync.

Thoughts and Prayers.
